It's an array of `social` object than contains `name`, `icon` and `url`

```

## Menu

The menu contains a `main` which is an array that contains a `name`, `url` and a `weight`.

Example:

```toml
[[menu.main]]
name = "Archives"
url = "/posts"
weight = 1

[[menu.main]]
name = "Tags"
url = "/tags"
weight = 2
```
